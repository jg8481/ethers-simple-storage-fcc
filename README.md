These are my notes while working on [Patrick's Javascript Blockchain/Smart Contract FreeCodeCamp Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ).

- On April 6, 2024 successfully compiled and deployed the following "EthersJS smart contract deployment and interaction" example code to interact with a locally installed Ganache fake blockchain node. I created a customziable set of build automation scripts that I will re-use in other sections of Patrick's YouTube course.
