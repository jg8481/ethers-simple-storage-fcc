------------------------------------[[[[ Tool Runner Script ]]]]------------------------------------


This tool runner script can be used to run the following commands to deploy the Solidity examples from Patrick Collin's FCC Solidity YouTube course.

You can view just this help menu again (without triggering any automation) by running 'bash ./Lesson5CodeSessions_start-deployment-scripts.sh -h' or 'bash ./Lesson5CodeSessions_start-deployment-scripts.sh -h --help'.

bash ./Lesson5CodeSessions_start-deployment-scripts.sh Stop-Local-Blockchain-Nodes-And-Delete-Logs

bash ./Lesson5CodeSessions_start-deployment-scripts.sh Start-EthersJS-Deployment-On-Ganache-Node
bash ./Lesson5CodeSessions_start-deployment-scripts.sh Start-EthersJS-Interact-Test

If you're running this for the first time run the following before running Start-EthersJS-Deployment-On-Ganache-Node.

bash ./Lesson5CodeSessions_start-deployment-scripts.sh Install-Tools-On-MacOS-Or-Linux
bash ./Lesson5CodeSessions_start-deployment-scripts.sh Compile-Solidity-Code-With-Yarn

Then you can run the following combined commands in your terminal to deploy the contract to the Ganache local blockchain node.

bash ./Lesson5CodeSessions_start-deployment-scripts.sh Stop-Local-Blockchain-Nodes-And-Delete-Logs && bash ./Lesson5CodeSessions_start-deployment-scripts.sh Start-EthersJS-Deployment-On-Ganache-Node

You can also use the provided Lesson5CodeSessions_start-automation-build-pipeline.sh to run all the above commands in a sequence similar to a build pipeline.
